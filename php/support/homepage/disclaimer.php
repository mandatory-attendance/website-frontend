        In presenting this work, we acknowledge that we attempted to contact representatives of the Kala Lagaw Ya people 
        but did not recieve a reply, and recognise the impact this may have on our treatment of the work. The work presented 
        is a proposal only. However, we will relinquish all proposed concepts as part of a collaborative and participatory design
        process for the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander custodians' to self determine the design process, purpose, 
        benefits and outcomes.
