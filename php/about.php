                        Kala Lagaw Ya is one of two traditional languages of the Torres Strait. Kala Lagaw Ya (also written as Kalaw Lagaw Ya) 
                        is the traditional language owned by the Western and Central islands of the Torres Strait. It is linguistically connected 
                        to the Aboriginal languages of the Australian mainland.

                            the editor of the group, it is my responsibility to ensure all aspects of our application
                            and report align with the requirements given by the brief, and to ensure all our work
                            is coherent and neat.
