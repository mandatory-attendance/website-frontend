                    <h1>Kala Lagaw Ya Origin</h1>
                    <p>
                        Kala Lagaw Ya is one of two traditional languages of the Torres Strait. Kala Lagaw Ya (also known as Kalaw Lagaw Ya) 
                        is the traditional language owned by the Western and Central islands of the Torres Strait. It is linguistically connected 
                        to the Aboriginal languages of the Australian mainland.

                    <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
                    <p>
                        We are a group of five students (Team Mandatory Attandance/ Mayfly) attending the University of Queensland who have collectively 
                        worked on this website for our Design Computing Studio 1 (DECO1800) course this semester (Semester 2, 2021). 
                        Our purpose in developing this application is to create an educational tool which assissts in teaching and
                        introducing the Kala Lagaw Ya language to primary school students (9 to 11 year olds).
                        As this language is classified as severely endangered, we seek to promote it and ensure their culture is not forgotten.

                            I was born in Phillippines, Naga City and moved here to Australia in 2011. I was brought up in a Filipino household
                            and have still been able to experience, to some extent, Filipino culture despite moving. I am in my 2nd year studying 
                            Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in User Experience Design. Reflecting on my own experiences and cultural heritage, 
                            I acknowledge the deep importance of language to one's culture, and this extends into my motivations for this project.

                        I was born in a small city named Sangrur of Punjab, India and I have been staying there for all my childhood 
                        till 2 years of my Bachelors in Software Engineering. I moved to Brisbane for my future studies and moving to 
                        Brisbane in 2019 brings my culture and language from my hometown which I respect and acknowledge. I understand 
                        the importance of language to a culture and I also respect to the land and people of Brisbane and its 
                        culture and language. I hope to learn more about the Indigenous Culture in Australia and pay my utmost respect 
                        to people of this land.

                        I was born in Brisbane, Queensland, and have lived here ever since. I am in my first year 
                        of a Bachelor of Information Technology, with a major in User Experience Design. I recognise 
                        my white privilege that I bring to this project. I also acknowledge that, for me, an information 
                        technology University degree provides an avenue to employment. By completing this project, I 
                        hope to learn more about Indigenous Australian Culture and languages, and learn how to bring 
                        awareness to the many issues they face.
