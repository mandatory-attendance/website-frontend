                    <h1>Kala Lagaw Ya Origin</h1>
                    <p>
                        Kala Lagaw Ya is one of two traditional languages of the Torres Strait. Kala Lagaw Ya (also known as Kalaw Lagaw Ya) 
                        is the traditional language owned by the Western and Central islands of the Torres Strait. It is linguistically connected 
                        to the Aboriginal languages of the Australian mainland.

            <section class="test-about-description1">
                    <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
                    <p>
                        We are a group of five students (Team Mandatory Attandance/ Mayfly) attending the University of Queensland who have collectively 
                        worked on this website for our Design Computing Studio 1 (DECO1800) course this semester (Semester 2, 2021). 
                        Our purpose in developing this application is to create an educational tool which assissts in teaching and
                        introducing the Kala Lagaw Ya language to primary school students (9 to 11 year olds).
                        As this language is classified as severely endangered, we seek to promote it and ensure their culture is not forgotten. 
                        (Torres Strait Island Language Plan, n.d.) 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have made an effort to connect directly with the community (phone and email), however, we are yet to receive a reponse. We intended
                        to work with members or representatives of the community to ensure that we were appropriately using their language and representing their culture.
                        As this was unfortunately not able to be carried out, we have instead made sure to have easily accessible disclaimers on each page of the website and
                        extensively researched sensitivity concerns regarding the Kala Lagaw Ya language and culture to found our project decisions on.

                        I am currently in my 2nd year studying a dual in Bachelor of Commerce and Information Technology, majoring in business 
                        information systems and user experience design.  I was born in Sydney, Australia and moved to Brisbane in 2011. 
                        Even though I have lived in Australia my whole life my parents who came to Australia 22 years ago from Indian 
                        have made sure that I was and still able to experience every part of my culture to the fullest extent. 
                        Reflecting on this and the task at hand, I am  able to acknowledge the deep importance of language to one’s culture.
                        By completing this project, I hope to learn more about the tradition landowner’s language and culture.

                            I was born in Phillippines, Naga City and moved here to Australia in 2011. I was brought up in a Filipino household
                            and have still been able to experience, to some extent, Filipino culture despite moving. I am in my 2nd year studying 
                            Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in User Experience Design. Reflecting on my own experiences and cultural heritage, 
                            I acknowledge the deep importance of language to one's culture, and this extends into my motivations for this project.
                            Through this project, I hope to learn and also help educate and encourage others in learning endangered Indegenous languages.

                        I was born in a small city named Sangrur of Punjab, India and I have been staying there for all my childhood

                        Brisbane in 2019 brings my culture and language from my hometown which I respect and acknowledge. I understand 
                        the importance of language to a culture and I also respect to the land and people of Brisbane and its 
                        culture and language. I hope to learn more about the Indigenous Culture in Australia and pay my utmost respect

                        I was born in Brisbane, Queensland, and have lived here ever since. My Mum was also born in Brisbane,
                        however my Dad is from Dunedin, New Zealand. Despite not visiting New Zealand, I still experienced the 
                        country's culture through my parents. I recognise my white privilege that I bring to this project, and 
                        I pay my respects to the traditional owners of the land on which I reside. I am  currently in my first 
                        year of a Bachelor of Information Technology, with a major in User Experience Design. I acknowledge that 
                        this degree provides an avenue to employment. By completing this project, I  hope to learn more about 
                        Indigenous Australian Culture and Customs, and learn how to bring awareness to the many issues they face.

                        <p>
                        I am currently studying Information Technology and majoring in Software Information Systems.  I was born in
                        a city called Medan, Indonesia and came to Brisbane 2 year ago. Although I lived in Indonesia for most of my life,
                        my family have maintained Chinese culture as my ancestors originated from China. Personally, I am interested in learning
                        languages and cultures, which has become my motivation for working on this project. When I first came to Australia,
                        I had no idea about Indigenous Australian Culture until I learned about First Australians culture during my foundation year.
                        This has piqued my interest and this project has become an opportunity ofr me to explore and understand their culture even deeper.
                        I also acknowledge the importance of Indeginous culture and language and respect the traditional landowners.
